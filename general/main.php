        For each instruction, one may be used fram each of these groups and be placed in any
        order Using redundant prefixes (more than one prefix from a group) is reserved and may cause
        unpredictable behavior.

        The LOCK prefix forces an atomic operation to insure exclusive use of shared memory in a
        multiprocessor environment See “LOCK—Assert LOCK# Signal Prefix” in Chapter 3, Instruction
        Set Reference, for a detailed description of this prefix and the instructions with which it can
        be used.

        The repeat prefixes cause an instruction to be repeated for each element of a string, They
        can be used only with the string instructions: MOVS, CMPS, SCAS, LODS, STOS, IMS, and OUTS,
        Use of the repeat prefixes with other IA-32 instructions is reserved and may cause unpredictable
        behavior (see the note below).

        The branch hint prefixes allow a program to give a hint to the processor about the mast
        likely code path that will be taken at a branch, These prefixes can only be used with the
        conditional branch instructions (Jec), Use of these prefixes with other 14-32 instructions is
        reserved and may cause unpredictable behavior The branch hint prefixes were introduced in the
        Pentium 4 and Intel Xenon processors as part of the S$SE2 extensions.
